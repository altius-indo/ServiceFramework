# Authorization Requirements

## 1. Access Control Models

### 2.2 Permission Inheritance
- Hierarchical resource permissions (folder â†’ files)
- Group membership permission inheritance
- Role hierarchy with inherited permissions

- Policy templates for common scenarios

### 3.2 Policy Evaluation
- Centralized policy decision point (PDP)

### 5.3 Cross-Tenant Collaboration
- Explicit opt-in for cross-tenant features
- Federated identity for guest access
- Shared spaces with mixed-tenant membership
- Audit trail for cross-tenant activities
- Data residency compliance for shared resources

## 6. Service Authorization

### 6.1 Service-to-Service Authorization

- Location-based access controls (IP ranges, geofencing)
- Device-based restrictions (managed devices only)
- Network-based controls (VPN required)
- Risk-based adaptive authorization

### 7.2 Just-In-Time Access
