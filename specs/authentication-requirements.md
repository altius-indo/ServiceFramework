# Authentication Requirements

## 1. Identity Management

### 1.1 Identity Providers
- Support multiple identity provider integrations (OIDC, SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0)
- Enable federation with corporate identity stores (Active Directory, LDAP)
- Support social identity providers for external users
- Allow custom identity provider implementations via plugin architecture

### 1.2 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Support TOTP-based authenticators (Google Authenticator, Authy)
- Enable SMS and email-based OTP delivery
- Support hardware security keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn)
- Provide biometric authentication options where supported
- Allow conditional MFA based on risk assessment

### 1.3 Service-to-Service Authentication
- Support mutual TLS (mTLS) for service mesh communication
- Implement service account management with rotating credentials
- Enable JWT-based service authentication
- Support API key authentication with scope limitations
- Implement workload identity federation

## 2. Token Management

### 2.1 Token Generation
- Issue JWT tokens with configurable claims and expiration
- Support both short-lived access tokens and long-lived refresh tokens
- Implement token signing with RS256, ES256, and HS256 algorithms
- Enable custom claim injection based on user context
- Support token encryption for sensitive payloads

### 2.2 Token Validation
- Validate token signatures against public key infrastructure
- Verify token expiration, not-before, and issuer claims
- Implement token revocation checking via revocation lists or introspection
- Cache validated tokens with TTL matching token expiration
- Support grace periods for clock skew tolerance

### 2.3 Token Lifecycle
- Implement secure token refresh mechanisms
- Provide token revocation endpoints and propagation
- Support sliding session windows with refresh token rotation
- Enable single sign-out (SLO) across services
- Implement token introspection endpoints for validation

## 3. Session Management

### 3.1 Session Storage
- Support distributed session storage (Redis, Memcached)
- Implement session replication across availability zones
- Enable sticky sessions with fallback mechanisms
- Support stateless session tokens for horizontally scalable architectures
- Provide session encryption at rest and in transit

### 3.2 Session Lifecycle
- Define configurable absolute and idle timeout policies
- Implement session renewal on activity
- Support concurrent session limits per user
- Enable session termination on security events
- Provide user-initiated session management and termination

## 4. Credential Management

### 4.1 Password Policies
- Enforce minimum complexity requirements (length, character classes)
- Implement password history to prevent reuse
- Support passwordless authentication flows
- Enable password expiration policies
- Implement secure password reset workflows with verification

### 4.2 Credential Storage
- Hash passwords using bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2
- Never store plaintext or reversibly encrypted passwords
- Implement secure key derivation functions with appropriate work factors
- Support credential migration during algorithm upgrades
- Encrypt service credentials at rest using HSM or key management services

## 5. Authentication Protocols

### 5.1 OAuth 2.0 / OIDC
- Support authorization code flow with PKCE
- Implement client credentials flow for service accounts
- Enable device authorization flow for limited input devices
- Support implicit and hybrid flows where necessary
- Implement token exchange for service delegation

### 5.2 SAML 2.0
- Support SP-initiated and IdP-initiated SSO flows
- Implement SAML assertion validation and signature verification
- Enable encrypted SAML assertions
- Support single logout (SLO) protocol
- Provide metadata endpoints for IdP configuration

## 6. Security Controls

### 6.1 Brute Force Protection
- Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- Deploy progressive delays on authentication failures
- Enable CAPTCHA challenges on suspicious activity
- Monitor and alert on credential stuffing patterns
- Support IP-based rate limiting on authentication endpoints

### 6.2 Attack Prevention
- Implement CSRF protection for authentication flows
- Enable secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
- Protect against timing attacks in credential validation
- Implement request signing for sensitive operations
- Deploy WAF rules for common authentication attacks

### 6.3 Audit and Compliance
- Log all authentication attempts (success and failure)
- Record MFA enrollment and usage events
- Maintain immutable audit trails for compliance
- Support integration with SIEM systems
- Generate compliance reports for authentication events

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

### 7.1 Performance
- Authentication latency < 100ms at p95
- Token validation latency < 10ms at p95
- Support 100,000+ authentications per second per instance
- Cache validation results with 99.9% hit rate
- Minimize authentication overhead on service requests

### 7.2 Reliability
- 99.99% availability for authentication services
- Implement circuit breakers for external identity providers
- Support graceful degradation when IdP unavailable
- Enable offline authentication caching where appropriate
- Provide redundancy across multiple availability zones

### 7.3 Scalability
- Horizontal scaling with no single points of failure
- Stateless authentication validation where possible
- Support multi-region deployment with low latency
- Handle traffic spikes without service degradation
- Auto-scale based on authentication load patterns
