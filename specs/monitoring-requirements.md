# Monitoring and Observability Requirements

## 1. Metrics Collection

### 1.1 Application Metrics
- Request rate, latency (p50, p95, p99), and error rate
- Active users and concurrent sessions
- Business KPIs (orders/hour, revenue, conversions)
- Custom application-specific metrics
- Real-time metric streaming to dashboards

### 1.2 Infrastructure Metrics
- CPU, memory, disk, network utilization
- Container and pod resource usage
- Database connections, query performance
- Cache hit rates and eviction rates
- Queue depths and message processing rates

### 1.3 Service Metrics
- Service availability and uptime
- Service dependency health
- API endpoint performance by route
- gRPC method call statistics
- Message broker throughput and lag

## 2. Logging

### 2.1 Application Logs
- Structured logging in JSON format
- Correlation IDs for request tracing
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL
- Contextual information (user ID, tenant ID, session ID)
- Performance metrics within log entries

### 2.2 Access Logs
- HTTP access logs with full request/response details
- Authentication and authorization events
- API usage tracking by client and endpoint
- Compliance-required access logging
- Privacy-sensitive data redaction

### 2.3 Audit Logs
- Immutable audit trail for compliance
- User actions on sensitive resources
- Configuration and policy changes
- Administrative operations
- Security events and incidents

## 3. Distributed Tracing

### 3.1 Trace Collection
- OpenTelemetry or similar instrumentation
- Span creation for all service calls
- Trace context propagation across services
- Sampling strategies for high-volume systems
- Custom span tags for business context

### 3.2 Trace Analysis
- End-to-end request flow visualization
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Error propagation analysis
- Service dependency mapping
- Critical path analysis

## 4. Alerting

### 4.1 Alert Types
- Threshold-based alerts (metric exceeds threshold)
- Anomaly detection alerts (deviation from baseline)
- Error rate alerts (spike in errors)
- Availability alerts (service down)
- Business metric alerts (revenue drop)

### 4.2 Alert Routing
- On-call rotation integration (PagerDuty, Opsgenie)
- Escalation policies for unacknowledged alerts
- Multi-channel notifications (Slack, email, SMS, phone)
- Alert deduplication and correlation
- Quiet hours and maintenance windows

### 4.3 Alert Management
- Alert acknowledgment and resolution tracking
- Runbook links for common alerts
- Alert tuning to reduce noise
- Historical alert analysis
- Post-incident alert review

## 5. Dashboards

### 5.1 Operational Dashboards
- Real-time system health overview
- Service status and dependencies
- Active incidents and alerts
- Key performance indicators
- Resource utilization trends

### 5.2 Service-Level Dashboards
- SLI/SLO tracking and burn rate
- Error budget consumption
- Latency percentile charts
- Throughput and capacity metrics
- Service-specific health metrics

### 5.3 Business Dashboards
- User activity and engagement
- Revenue and conversion metrics
- Feature usage analytics
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Business outcome tracking

## 6. Performance Requirements

### 6.1 Metric Collection
- Sub-second metric ingestion latency
- Support 1M+ metrics per second
- 99.9% metric delivery reliability
- Minimal overhead on monitored services (<1%)
- Automatic metric aggregation and rollups

### 6.2 Log Processing
- Real-time log indexing (<10s from generation)
- Support 100GB+ logs per day
- Full-text search on logs
- Log retention: 30 days hot, 1 year cold
- Privacy-compliant log handling

### 6.3 Trace Processing
- <5s trace availability after request completion
- Support 100K+ traces per second
- Trace retention: 7 days detailed, 30 days sampled
- Low sampling overhead (<1ms per span)
- Trace search and filtering

## 7. Compliance and Security

### 7.1 Data Privacy
- PII redaction in logs and metrics
- Encryption of sensitive monitoring data
- Access controls on monitoring systems
- Data retention policies
- Right to be forgotten support

### 7.2 Audit Requirements
- Monitoring system access logs
- Configuration change tracking
- Alert modification audit trail
- Dashboard view tracking
- Compliance report generation

## 8. Integration Points

### 8.1 Metric Sources
- Application instrumentation (Prometheus, StatsD)
- Infrastructure monitoring (CloudWatch, Datadog)
- Database metrics (slow query logs, connection pools)
- Message broker metrics (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- External service metrics (SaaS, third-party APIs)

### 8.2 Alerting Destinations
- Incident management (PagerDuty, Opsgenie)
- Team communication (Slack, Microsoft Teams)
- Ticketing systems (Jira, ServiceNow)
- Email and SMS notifications
- Custom webhooks for integrations

### 8.3 Visualization Tools
- Grafana for metrics dashboards
- Kibana for log analysis
- Jaeger for distributed tracing
- Custom dashboards via API
- Mobile apps for on-call engineers
